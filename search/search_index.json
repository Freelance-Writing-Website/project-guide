However, in this project case the web-interface will include no direct access from both parties, the freelancer (writer) and client (the Job provider). On that note, this project will feature distinct interfaces for freelancers and clients, an admin panel for site management, and a streamlined workflow for project posting, assignment, and completion. Each freelancer will be assigned a Unique ID for tracking and management purposes. Similarly, paid clients will be provided with access to the website ensuring direct access to all our features and constant work updates from the
