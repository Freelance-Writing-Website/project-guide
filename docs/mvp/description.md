# Description

## Project Overview

The Freelance Writer Project Management Platform is a comprehensive web
application designed to facilitate interactions between freelance writers and
clients seeking writing services. However, in this project case the web-interface
will include no direct access from both parties, the freelancer (writer) and client
(the Job provider). On that note, this project will feature distinct interfaces
for freelancers and clients, an admin panel for site management, and a streamlined
workflow for project posting, assignment, and completion. Each freelancer will
be assigned a Unique ID for tracking and management purposes. Similarly, paid clients
will be provided with access to the website ensuring direct access to all our
features and constant work updates from the freelancer.
