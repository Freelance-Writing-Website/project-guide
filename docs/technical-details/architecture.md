# Architecture

??? Info "This is not final"

    Further deliberations can be made on the best architectures to
    use that the developers are well conversant in and that can do
    the intended job well.

    Also a diagram displaying the full architecture from client to
    server and database should be drawn to ensure the process is well
    understood and that it makes sense and no component is missing.

The architecture of the Freelance Writing Platform is designed to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance. It follows a modern web application architecture comprising the following components:

## Frontend

Built with React.js or Angular.js to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

## Backend

Developed using Node.js with Express.js for handling server-side logic, API development, and business logic.

## Database

Utilizes MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store and manage user data, project details, transaction records, and other relevant information.

## Authentication

Employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and session management.

## File Storage

AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage is used for storing and retrieving project-related files securely.

## DevOps

Incorporates CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. The application is hosted on reliable platforms such as AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.

## Monitoring and Logging

Implements monitoring tools like New Relic or Prometheus for tracking performance, logging errors, and ensuring system reliability.
