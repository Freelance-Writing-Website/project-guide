# Mockups

??? Info "This is not final"

    The mockups need to be designed in a design tool like `Figma`
    so that the designs can be polished and reviewed before actual
    coding of the frontend.

Mockups will provide a visual representation of the user interfaces and help in planning the layout and functionality of the application. For the Freelance Writing Platform, mockups will include:

   	- Freelancer Dashboard: Displays available projects, notifications, profile management options, and project management tools.
   	- Client Dashboard: Features project posting forms, freelancer search tools, communication interfaces, and payment processing options.
   	- Admin Panel: Showcases user management interfaces, project oversight tools, content moderation options, analytics, and reporting features.
   	- Login/Sign-Up Pages: Simple and intuitive pages for user registration and authentication.
